## Research Question

How can COVID-19 immunization data be effectively integrated into routine Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems to improve healthcare delivery, clinical decision-making, and public health preparedness in Michigan?
## Methodology

This project employed a multi-site research strategy and a comprehensive literature review. The following steps were taken:

- Literature Review: Key studies were analyzed to understand trends, tools, and frameworks used in EHR and Immunization Information System (IIS) integration.
- Multi-Site Data Collection: Data were collected from academic medical centers across the U.S. with a focus on Michigan.
- EHR Analysis: Utilized standard data formats such as HL7 and FHIR to analyze integration efficiency.
- Qualitative Surveys: Feedback was gathered from healthcare professionals to assess workflow impact and integration success.
- Tool Evaluation: Reviewed tools linking disease surveillance systems with IIS for their interoperability and efficiency.

## Key Findings

- 100% of medical centers used EHRs for real-time COVID-19 tracking.
- 95% successfully integrated vaccination tracking into EHRs.
- 90% of agencies reported more efficient data exchange.
- 40% improvement in data accuracy and 30% reduction in integration time.
- 85% of public health workers reported improved workflow efficiency.

These findings highlight the success of data integration efforts while emphasizing persistent technical and policy-related barriers.

## Challenges Identified

- Technical inconsistency across EHR platforms
- Lack of standardized data-sharing protocols
- Privacy and security concerns (HIPAA compliance)
- Resistance to adopting new systems
- Limited IT infrastructure in rural communities

## Opportunities for Future Research

- Development of universal interoperability standards
- Cost-effective models for small providers
- Enhanced patient engagement tools (e.g., mobile apps)
- Integration of broader public health data
- Focus on health equity in immunization coverage
- Training for healthcare professionals in data management

## Importance to Public Health

This research underscores the transformative potential of integrated immunization data within EHRs to:

- Improve vaccine distribution and monitoring
- Strengthen public health surveillance
- Support real-time, data-driven clinical decisions
- Enhance readiness for future pandemics
- Reduce administrative workload for providers
- Empower patients with accessible health records
- Support research and policy development

## My Personal Contribution

As part of the research team, I (Mary Nnipaa Meteku):

- Led the literature review on health informatics tools and interoperability standards (HL7, FHIR).
- Synthesized case studies and real-world data on EHR integration from Michigan and other jurisdictions.
- Co-wrote and edited the main sections of the report.
- Analyzed survey results to identify healthcare provider experiences and system efficiencies.
- Designed key visual elements (charts/figures) to present data integration impacts.
- Contributed insights from my public health and health informatics background to align the project with practical healthcare needs and policy contexts.
